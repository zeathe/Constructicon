#   Overview:
#
#      Constructicon is a build wrapper/driver script to support builds
#      adhering to Constructicon standards.  The build system is designed
#      to provide for local dev builds from file or GIT Repo, localized
#      consumer builds of source (direct pull of released version tags),
#      and completely controlled official builds with publishing and
#      back-tagging into a master GIT Repo.
#
#      Constructicon does the heavy lifting around a series of ANT scripts
#      for a fully functional build infrastructure to support just about
#      any level of controlled building needs.
#
#      Constructicon has been designed to modularly reside within any
#      number of build management tools (Hudson, CruiseControl, ccNET,
#      custom scripts, or other build manager) and provide some
#      flexibility.
